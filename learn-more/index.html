            <p>I'm a self-taught programmer with plenty of experience in computer science and programming.</p>
            <p>I have mastered programming in many languages and frameworks since I have been working on many different projects, Which needed advanced problem solving skills.</p>

      <h1>My journey</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="ea-pure-paragraph">
      <p>I have started my journey as a Unity game developer. I have made my first game with the help of an article in 2018.</p>
      <p>Also the first programming language that I got familiar with was C#, which was required for programming inside Unity engine. Still programming was very hard for me back then, and I couldn't even write a line of code on my own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ea-image-paragraph">
      <div class="ea-image"> 
        <img src="/assets/images/learn-more/planning.jpg" alt="Drawing dumb things on paper while you are programming makes you more practical I guess.">
      </div>

      <div class="ea-paragraph">
        <p>During the Covid pandemic, I've got plenty of time to spend on programming. I learned Node.js which was a lot easier than C#. Then I started learning web development. I got familiar with HTML and CSS which was pretty exciting. It finally felt like I'm making some progress.</p>
        <p>This was when I got my first job. I was hired by a small business and my job was to create a website for them. Also the whole networking and IT engineering was my duty to take care of. Since I was all by my own, it took three months to build that website.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ea-pure-paragraph">
      <p>After the job ended I started exploring more about programming and different areas of it. I knew web development was not enough for me.</p>
      <p>I always wanted to know how applications work and what goes on behind the scenes. I realized I needed a different framework and programming language to start my software engineering journey.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ea-image-paragraph">
      <div class="ea-paragraph">
        <p>Some of my close friends said I need to learn Python to learn software engineering. And so I did. I read some articles and watched some youtube videos. I made my first app with TKinter and published it to github which was a huge progress for me.</p>
        <p>But soon after I realized that python isn't going to cut it. The GUI was ugly and it would get flagged by anti-virus softwares (Thanks to pyinstaller).</p>
        <p>Also I found out that object oriented programming languages are generally a better option for bigger projects. (I hated Python)</p>
      </div>

    <div class="ea-pure-paragraph">
      <p>I started searching for something more powerfull that can also run cross-platform. There were many options like React native and Flutter. But still I wanted something better and more low level.</p>
      <p>Since I had a background in C#, I wondered if it can run cross-platform or not (Which it could). This was when I started really learning C#. I made a .NET MAUI project which was a pretty new framework.</p>
    </div>

      </div>

      <div class="ea-paragraph">
        <p>I created my first two cross-platform apps using .NET MAUI and published them to github.</p>
      <p>I also enchanced my web development skills and started working on APIs and advanced concepts of it. I also managed to create this website.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ea-pure-paragraph">
      <p>Until today I'm still learning and constantly improving my skills in programming. I am really happy that I am able solve problems with my programming skills.</p>
