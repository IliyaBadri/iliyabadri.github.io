            <p>I'm a self-taught programmer and game developer.</p>
            <p>I have mastered programming in many languages and frameworks and I ne have worked on many different projects which needed advanced problem solving skills.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="PureParagraph">
      <p>I have started my journey as a Unity game developer. I have made my first game with the help of an article in 2018.</p>
      <p>Also the first programming language that I got familiar with was C#, which was required for programming inside Unity engine. Still, programming was very hard for me back then, and I couldn't even write a line of code on my own.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>During the Covid pandemic, I've got plenty of time to spend on programming. I learned Node.js which was a lot easier than C#. Then I started learning web development. I got familiar with HTML and CSS which was pretty exciting. It finally felt like I'm making some progress.</p>
        <p>This was when I got my first job. I was hired by a small business and my job was to create a website for them. Also the whole networking and IT engineering was my duty to take care of. Since I was all by my own, it took three months to build that website.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="PureParagraph">
      <p>After the job ended I started exploring more about programming and different areas of it. I knew web development was not enough for me.</p>
      <p>I always wanted to know how applications work and what goes on behind the scenes. I realized I needed a different framework and programming language to start my software engineering journey.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ImageParagraph">
      <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>Some of my close friends said I need to learn Python to learn software engineering. And so I did. I read some articles and watched some youtube videos. I made my first app with TKinter and published it to github which was a huge progress for me.</p>
        <p>But soon after I realized that python isn't going to cut it. The GUI was ugly and it would get flagged by anti-virus softwares (Thanks to pyinstaller).</p>
        <p>Also I found out that object-oriented programming languages are generally a better option for bigger projects. (I hated Python)</p>

      <p>I started searching for something more powerfull that can also run cross-platform. There were many options like React native and Flutter. But still I wanted something better and more low level.</p>
      <p>Since I had a background in C#, I wondered if it can run cross-platform or not (Which it could). This was when I started really learning C#. I made a .NET MAUI project which was a pretty new framework.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>I created my first two cross-platform apps using .NET MAUI and published them to github.</p>
      <p>I also enchanced my web development skills and started working on APIs and advanced concepts of it. I also managed to create this website.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="PureParagraph">
      <p>Over time I learned how to use Git better. I started using branches to manage my workflow. This allowed me to build a project that I've had in my mind for a long time. So I built <a href="https://github.com/IliyaBadri/EnLaunch">EnLaunch</a>. It took a long amount of time.</p>
      <p>Well it was a Windows Forms application and managing that workflow all by myself, alongside testing the launcher for bugs, was a pretty long process for me as a solo dev. I tried to get feedback from others and fix it as best as I can. I published three releases and then decided to stop.</p>
      <p>Maybe later I would work on it again.</p>

        <p>I had to face it. I didn't know how these programming languages work behind the scene. And I had to face with a low level language like C++ sooner or later. So, just for doing some experiment, I started working on <a href="https://github.com/IliyaBadri/GraphC">GraphC</a>. I learned how to make a bitmap image by processing pixels byte by byte. It was a different experience. It was important to know that even though I'm not doing much, I have full control over what I do. (I also realized how fast Hash Maps are!)</p>

      <p>I wanted to resume my game dev path again. But as the time of this writing, Unity became pretty limiting for its free users. And I just wanted to use an open-source software to develop my game.</p>
      <p>Since I like 3D games I chose Godot. It supported C# which was pretty nice and it was just like Unity in some ways. It lacked some features though. So I had to learn Blender too. (For animations and stuff)</p>
      <p>Right now I'm working on my game named Tenant. It's a simple singleplayer fps game. But, It's enough to make me underestand the basics of game dev.</p>
