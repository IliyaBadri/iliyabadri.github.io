        <h1>Usage</h1>
        <p>Note: If you have downloaded the windows installation program you will need to run the program as adminstraitor to grant the app to write changes to the database file.</p>
        <p>Each time you open the program you will be asked for the master password.</p>
        <h2>Note:</h2>
        <h4>If you lose your master password there is <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/no-way">NO WAY</a> to retrive it back.</h4>
        <h4>After the first opening of the program you will be asked for the master password and the password you enter will not be directly saved to the file system and it will be hashed in Argon2 hashing algorithm.</h4>
        <h4>This way the program can check your master pasword with the hash but the program itself does not store the password in plain text.</h4>
        <h4>The only way you can retrive your password back is cracking the Argon2 hash which will be stored in key.hash file next to the python script or windows executeable.</h4>
        <h4>And please note that Argon2 takes an <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eternity">ethernity</a> to crack.</h4>
        <h2>After the download was complete:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When you have entered your master password the password manager will open and decrypt the passwords database.</p>
        <p>In this panel to add a password you will need to enter your prefered fields in the Inputs frame on the right side of the screen and then click on the "Add new password" button.</p>
        <p>To edit a field in the database you need to first enter the ID of the password row and then overwrite that with the other input fields and then click "Edit password by ID" button.</p>
        <p>To delete a password you will need to enter the password row ID in the input panel and click on the "Delete password by ID" button.</p>
